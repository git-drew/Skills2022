TASK 1 : Manage Github Scripts and documents 

Task preparation => Run vm, Create new foldder in local host according to lab practice files.

Task implementation => Use git--init to initiate a new repository from chosen directory, then add new origin to it with git "add" command/

Task Troubleshooting=> Experence merged file errors, but fixed it with the help of the lab files. it was easy at first getting to push in a file to github, but when all tasks were finished and a little mistake was made, it was difficult tryiing to fix this. it terms of ediitng i prefer directly entrying github to do so. transfer sped for me was lacking at some point. 

Task verification=> two screenshots have been added to file for verification purposes
